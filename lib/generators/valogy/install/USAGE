Description:
  Valogy gives two ways to translate Ontologies as Database Constraints the
  first way is via rake taks, which is accessible after installation and the
  other way is using HTTP. With this generator you can install an Controller
  and a view to your app. 

Example:
    This generator will create the Valogy Controller and the view

    rails g valogy:install

    This will create:
        app/controllers/valogy_controller.rb
        app/views/valogy/new.html.erb or app/views/valogy/new.html.haml
