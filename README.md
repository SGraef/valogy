Valogy
=======

Valogy is an Rails-Gem for using OWL-Ontologies to validate the Input
of User input. The advantage of this gem is that you don't have to
write new code and deploy the application new. You only have to Upload
an Ontology to the application and it will change the validation functions in the database.
